ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nuradiansyah

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently working as a researcher on the topics of data privacy and ontology. My current work aims at investigating the problem of ontology repairs in a fragment of first-order logic, called description logics. 
Mainly, I am working on the theoretical side of solving this problem, but luckily I also have an experience in building an implemention for repairing the large datasets of the form of ontologies
In a more detail, you can visit the codes of the implementation here --> https://github.com/de-tu-dresden-inf-lat/abox-repairs-wrt-static-tbox

ðŸŒ± I also have a good memory in performing a data analysis process within my bachelor thesis. Right now, such an experience encourages me further to learn about data analysis. 

The repository would likely to be filled in with what I perceive as a learning curve of my understanding in logic, privacy, and data analysis
