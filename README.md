ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nuradiansyah

ðŸ“–Iâ€™m currently working as a researcher on the topics of data privacy and ontology. My current research work aims at investigating approaches to solving the problem of ontology repairs in a fragment of first-order logic, called description logics. 
In addition to the theoretical side of solving this problem, I was involved in the implemention of repairing a large collection of ontologies, in a sense that the ontologies do no longer contain errors or unwanted information. The codes of the implementation can be accessed here --> https://github.com/de-tu-dresden-inf-lat/abox-repairs-wrt-static-tbox.

ðŸŒ± What's more, I have internship experience in building a geospatial dashboard for visualizing the distribution of affiliated partners of my internship company together with their unit sales. Such a historic experience motivates me again to revamp some important data analysis skills.

This Github Profile would likely be mainly occupied with what I perceive as a learning curve of my understanding of data and knowledge representation.
