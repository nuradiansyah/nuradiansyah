👋 Hi, I’m @nuradiansyah

I am currently an ontology management expert in DigitalScience, an AI-centered company providing scientific- and research-supporting tools. I am mainly responsible in developing and maintaining ontologies covering life science-related domains ranging from thousand up to million number of concepts. Specifically, I build up my ontology engineering skills in implementing ontology merging and mapping approaches as well as concept redundancies removal. To be more precise, the developed ontologies will be used as data points in Dimensions Knowledge Graph, one of the products of DigitalScience

📖Previously, I worked as a researcher on the topics of data privacy and ontology. My research work aimed at investigating approaches to solving the problem of ontology repairs in a fragment of first-order logic, called description logics. 
In addition to the theoretical side of solving this problem, I was involved in the implementation of repairing a large collection of ontologies, in a sense that the ontologies do no longer contain errors or unwanted information. The codes of the implementation can be accessed here --> https://github.com/de-tu-dresden-inf-lat/abox-repairs-wrt-static-tbox.

🌱 What's more, I have an internship experience in building a geospatial dashboard for visualizing the distribution of affiliated partners of my internship company together with their unit sales.
